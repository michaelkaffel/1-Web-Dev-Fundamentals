        <p>Jasmin Crockett was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, where she quickly developed the resilience and
            determination that would define her career. The <a
                href="https://www.theroot.com/the-evolution-of-jasmine-crockett-1851514946?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
                target="_blank">daughter of working-class parents</a>, she grew up with a strong
            sense of justice and an unshakable belief in standing up for what's right. After earning her undergraduate
            degree in business, she went on to study law at the <a href="https://www.tsulaw.edu/"
                target="_blank">Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern
                University</a>, where she honed her passion for civil rights and advocacy. Those early years shaped her
            into the
            fighter she is today—grounded in community, fueled by purpose, and ready to take on powerful institutions in
            the name of fairness and equality.
